This is a stupidly simple [Electron app](https://electronjs.org/) that flips between YouTube Music, SoundCloud, and Bandcamp so I'm not constantly closing the browser window with my music when I wipe out my tabs. To flip between services just right click. *That's all it does.*

To build for Mac use **electron-build**: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder
